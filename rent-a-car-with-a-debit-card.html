						<h1>How to Rent a Car with a Debit Card</h1>
				
                        
                

Can you rent a car with a debit card? There are a ton of people who use debit cards, yet rental agencies often place extra restrictions on people who use them. Often, rental car companies prefer the use of credit cards so that they can ensure that the customer will be able to pay for unexpected charges that may be incurred during the rental period. For many years, a credit card has been the preferred method of payment for all rental agencies. The good news is that some agencies are relaxing their rules and making it easier for people to rent using debit cards. 
<p><p>
Why are rental companies adjusting their regulations to allow for people to pay for cars with debit cards? It comes down to accessibility. Approximately 25-30% of Americans do not have a credit card, and making it more expensive or difficult for them to rent cars may be unnecessary when they are able to cover the cost without going into debt. And most importantly, the rental agencies will earn more loyal customers by making these policy changes in favor of debit card customers. 

<h3>Requirements for Renting a Car with a Debit Card</h3>
Many companies place stricter requirements upon customers who want to rent a car with a debit card. According to Kevin Channing of Bankrate, if you plan to rent using a debit card, you can expect to comply with one or more of these requirements: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a bank-issued debit card with a Visa, Mastercard, or Discover logo. 
<li>Pay a deposit of approximately $200 in addition to the cost of the rental. This places a hold for the deposit amount on the account tied to your card. 
<li>Provide extra identification, such as a passport or utility bill. 
<li>Offer proof of insurance, or potentially purchase more from the rental company. 
<li>Undergo a credit check. (If your score is too low, a company may refuse to rent to you.) 
<li>Show a return ticket. Some rental companies at airport locations require proof of your return travel plans. 
</ul>

These policies vary from one company to another, as well as from one location to another.
<p>
<h3>Renting a Car With a Debit Card at the Airport</h3>
Rental agencies generally have fewer requirements for customers traveling with documentation. This is great news for customers who are renting at airport locations and have proof of a return flight. 
<p>
You will find that some companies are friendlier than others when you are renting a car at an airport location. We have found that these companies have the friendliest policies for customers who have a return ticket: 
<ul>
<li><a href="https://carrentalsavers.ca/dollar.html">Dollar</a>
<li><a href="https://carrentalsavers.com/alamo.html" >Alamo</a>
<li><a href="https://carrentalsavers.com/enterprise.html">Enterprise</a>
<li><a href="https://carrentalsavers.com/national.html">National </a>
<li><a href="https://carrentalsavers.ca/thrifty.html">Thrifty</a>
</ul>

You can read more about their policies below. If you have questions about the policy of a particular company, please contact us! 
<h3>Where Can I Rent a Car with a Debit Card?</h3>
You are likely wondering how many companies have changed their policies. Which car rental companies allow you to use a debit card? Many rental agencies now have policies which allow customers to rent cars using debit cards. Policies differ from one agency to another. These car rental companies allow you to use debit cards as long as you comply with their individual regulations. 

<h4><a href="https://carrentalsavers.com/advantage.html">Advantage Rent A Car Debit Card Policy</a></h4>

Debit/Check Cards must have the available funds of the estimated amount of the rental charges plus up to $350 in order to secure the rental.<p> 
Eligible debit card must have Visa, MasterCard, or Discover logo. Store value/prepaid/gift cards are not acceptable to qualify for rental but may be used at time of return. <p>
Customers will need to present a current driver’s license and a valid credit or charge card in the renter’s name. Use of a debit card to rent a vehicle is subject to review of your credit history at the time of your rental. (Note: A confirmation of your reservation does not mean that your debit/check card is acceptable to Advantage). <p>
Refunds of your deposit or any other funds owed to you are posted by Advantage upon close of your contract when you return the vehicle. However, depending on your financial institution, the transaction can take up to 21 days to process.<p>
<h4><a href="https://carrentalsavers.com/alamo.html">Alamo Car Rental Debit Card Policy</a></h4>
Debit and check cards are considered to be any non-credit card bearing the Visa, Mastercard or Discover logo.<p> <p>
When renting a car in the US, debit cards are accepted for customers with proof they have deplaned or disembarked at the rental location. Customers must have proof of a ticketed return or outbound trip from the location where the vehicle will be returned on an airline, cruise ship or train. For customers not deplaning or disembarking at the rental location and/or do not have evidence of a return or outbound trip, debit/check cards are only accepted as a form of payment at the time of return. This applies to all airport, sea port, train and bus station locations in the US and Canada.
<h4><a href="https://carrentalsavers.ca/avis.html">Avis Rent A Car Debit Card Policy</a></h4>
Can I rent a car from Avis with a debit card? You can, and here are the company’s policies: 
<p><p>
You will not need a deposit to rent a car from Avis, but you will need to present an acceptable form of payment. Avis accepts debit cards with a Visa or MasterCard logo.  
In most cases, U.S. locations will accept debit cards to determine credit worthiness at the time of rental. <p>
A hold will be placed on the funds in your account for the amount of the rental plus other possible expenses, not to exceed $500. When the car rental is over, the held funds will be reversed and released, but keep in mind that banks may take time to post them back to the account. 
<p>Debit cards are not acceptable to pick up premium car rentals. 
<p>Avis locations where you may experience difficulties renting a car with a debit card include: Metropolitan NY Tri-State area, Hartford, CT, Philadelphia area, Mississippi or Louisiana locations as well as other locations across the country. Canada locations do not accept bank debit cards as a form of credit identification. Debit cards are acceptable for payment at the completion of your rental. 
<p>Avis also offers a split billing payment option which provides billing flexibility. Customers may split their rental charges on two separate credit/debit cards. This can make renting a car with a debit card easier. 
<h4><a href="https://carrentalsavers.ca/budget.html" >Budget Rent A Car Debit Card Policy</a></h4>
Does Budget accept debit cards? Yes! Budget accepts debit cards for reserving, picking up, and paying for a rental car. They accept Visa and MasterCard debit cards only. 
<p><p>A hold for the estimated rental charges plus 25% is placed on the funds in your account, but only $100 is held if you prepay online (except in certain northeastern locations which require a $500 minimum hold).
<p>Budget does not allow premium car rental with a debit card, and some locations will check your credit while others will only require a third form of ID. Visit here to find debit card terms for your preferred Budget rental location. 

<h4><a href="https://carrentalsavers.ca/dollar.html" >Dollar Rent A Car Debit Card Policy</a></h4>
Dollar accepts debit cards issued under a Visa, MasterCard or Discover logo. These may be used at the outset of a rental if the reservation for the rental was made 24 hours prior to vehicle pick-up. If the reservation was not made 24 hours prior to vehicle pick-up OR you are renting a luxury, premium or convertible car class, a debit card may still be used where the following two (2) requirements are met:
<ul>
<li>Show a valid driver’s license and one other form of identification.
<li>Show proof of a return travel ticket to coincide with the rental (airline or cruise).
</ul>
Dollar will not perform a credit check as long as the above requirements are met and the debit card has available funds to cover the estimated charges plus an authorization of USD 200.00. 
<p>To find out if your desired Dollar location will consider a debit card as acceptable ID to pick up a car, find the location and call them directly; this information is not available online or contact us. 

<h4><a href="https://carrentalsavers.com/enterprise.html">Enterprise Rent A Car Debit Card Policy</a></h4>

<h4><a href="https://carrentalsavers.com/e-z-rent-a-car.html">EZ Rent A Car Debit Card Policy</a></h4>

<h4>Renting a Car with a Credit Card is Preferable</h4>

You may be wondering why rental companies prefer credit cards. Here are a few reasons why renting a car with a credit card is preferable to renting with a debit card: 
<ul>
<li>Many credit cards provide additional insurance. 
<li>Funds are held or taken from your bank account when you use a debit card and often not returned until up to 2-3 weeks after your rental car is returned. 
<li>Data shows that it is riskier to allow people to rent using a debit card. 
</ul>
When you rent a car using a credit card, the rental company has the reassurance that you have been vetted by the credit card company, that you are who you say you are, and that you will be able to cover any additional costs or potential damage to the car.
